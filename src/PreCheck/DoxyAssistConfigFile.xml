  <!-- You can set global settings here. The doxyfile attribute defines the
       Doxyfile to load by default. If none is given, or the template cannot be
       loaded, the default Doxygen settings are used as base.

       You can include any setting here, and it will be passed to Doxygen
       (even if it is not a recognized setting). You can add as many as you like,
       overriding the template or default Doxyfile.

       The given template file will never be overwritten by Doxygen Assistant.
       Instead the project specific version will be kept in memory and written
       to Doxygen over a pipe.

       Note that some settings are always overridden due to project definitions.
       See the information near the projects for more information. Changing these
       settings here will have no effect when using the Doxygen Assistant to
       run Doxygen. -->

  <!-- Settings for the Qt Help Collection to create. If not present, no
       help collection will be created. See
       http://doc.trolltech.com/assistant-custom-help-viewer.html for a
       description of all settings; the inner configuration is copied directly
       into the <assistant> section of the project file.

       The collectionFile attribute contains the path to the collection file to
       create (this file must be writable). Additionally provide the name for the
       project file in the projectFile attribute. By default this is the same
       as the collection file, with an extension of "qhcp" instead of "qhc"

       The storage attribute defines the subdirectory to place copies of Qt
       Compressed Help files in. The copyAction attribute defaults to making
       actual copies; this attribute can be set to "copy", "move" and "symlink".

    <!-- A project contains information about one Doxygen run, as well as
         as well as subprojects. It can have its completely own Doxygen
         configuration.

         Various settings are determined by the Doxygen Assistant; they will
         always override the Doxyfile settings. All values are by default inherited
         from the parent project, or empty if there is nothing to inherit from,
         unless noted otherwise. Note that even if a value is empty, this will
         override the Doxyfile settings. The following Doxyfile settings are
         overridden:
         - PROJECT_NAME
         - PROJECT_VERSION
         - INPUT
         - EXCLUDE
